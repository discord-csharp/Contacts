# Contacts [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/discord-csharp/Contacts.svg?branch=dev)](https://travis-ci.org/discord-csharp/Contacts)

Contacts is a Discord Bot that is actively developed and maintained by the C# Discord Server. Its aim is to make it easier to moderate the Discord Chat and to provide a small toolkit for answering questions about C# and .Net.

## Features

The roadmap of Contacts changed a lot since the first kickoff. A lot of people contributed good ideas which made its way into the bot. For now, the following modules made its way into the Contacts Bot:

**Moderation**

- Mass-deleting of messages
- Muting a person for N:N:N amount of time
- Logging leaves and joins as well as used commands.


**Toolkit**

- MSDN Lookup
- .Net source lookup
- Discord User whois
- Unflipping tables

## Installation
 - Navigate to Contacts/ContactsBot/Configs/ directory
 - Modify two configuration files in each directory under ContactsBot/Config/ (PostgreSQLConfiguration and BotConfiguration) and provide necessary informations and configuration.
 
 Note: default.json is for release build and dev.json is for debug build. (Visual Studios Solution file is configured to debug build with DEV define flag.)
 
 Note: Add your bot token to "Token" line in default.json under BotConfiguration directory, to learn how to add bot to discord: https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me
 
 - Once configured both PostgreSQLConfiguration and BotConfiguration, open the solution in Visual Studios 2017 RC
 - Open Package Manager Console under View/Other Windows/Package Manager Console and execute "Update-Database Initial" to add default schema and tables to configured PostgreSQL database.
 - Now run your bot and see if it works. If not, please add issue.
